# Contributing to the EDEN Research Framework

We invite contributions from the scientific community and industrial partners to advance the modeling of healthy longevity ecosystems. EDEN operates at the intersection of **Computer Science**, **Economics**, and **Public Health**, and we welcome interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Areas for Collaboration

### 1. Dataset Expansion (Ecosystem Mapping)
The robustness of the NMF model depends on the diversity of the underlying corpus. We seek contributions of structured value proposition data (`0_Longevity World.xlsx`) from:
*   **Digital Therapeutics (DTx)** manufacturers.
*   **Insurers** (Payers) with preventative health portfolios.
*   **Clinical providers** integrating remote monitoring.

### 2. Algorithmic Refinement
We welcome improvements to the computational core:
*   Optimization of the **NMF topic extraction** parameters.
*   Alternative similarity metrics for the **Network Analysis** module (e.g., Jaccard, Euclidean).
*   Enhanced visualization techniques for high-dimensional market data.

## Contribution Protocol
This repository follows standard open-source research practices:

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own workspace.
2.  **Feature Branching**: Create a branch for your specific contribution (e.g., `feature/improved-clustering`).
3.  **Pull Request**: Submit a PR with a detailed description of the methodological improvement or data addition.

## Translational Impact & Financial Disclosure
EDEN is a research initiative developed under the aegis of the **Centre for Digital Health Interventions (CDHI)** at **ETH Zurich** and the **University of St. Gallen**.

The framework is designed to produce "investor-grade" analytics—rigorous, data-driven insights capable of informing capital allocation in the longevity economy. Scaling this impact requires transparency regarding our strategic partners:

*   **CSS**: Supporting research into the "Future of Health" and incentive alignment.
*   **MavieNext**: Providing domain expertise in business model verification.
*   **MTIP**: Advising on the healthtech investment landscape.

## Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your code will be licensed under the **MIT License** to ensure maximum reproducibility and reusability by the scientific community.
